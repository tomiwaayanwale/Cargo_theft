# Cargo Theft Dataset Analysis (2013â€“2023)

## Project Overview

This project analyzes cargo theft data from 2013 to 2023 to uncover actionable insights and trends. The goal is to help businesses and authorities understand the patterns of cargo theft, identify high-risk areas and property types, and use this information to improve security measures.

### Dataset

The dataset contains information on cargo theft incidents across various states in the United States. Key features include:

Year of theft

State of occurrence

Property type involved in the theft

Stolen value

Theft count (number of stolen items)


Objectives

The objectives of this project are:

To identify trends in theft occurrences over time.

To analyze the distribution of theft incidents by state.

To identify the most targeted property types for theft.

To analyze theft occurrences on a monthly and seasonal basis.

To explore correlations between different variables in the dataset.


Tools and Libraries

Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis.

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Plotly: For interactive data visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: For conducting the analysis and creating a report.


Key Insights

1. Yearly Theft Trends: The analysis of theft trends over time helps identify periods with high or low theft activity, highlighting potential spikes in thefts.


2. Regional Analysis: Identifying the states with the highest theft rates and total stolen value can guide law enforcement and cargo companies in resource allocation.


3. Property Type Analysis: Analyzing which property types are most commonly targeted for theft provides valuable information for securing vulnerable goods.


4. Seasonal Trends: The analysis reveals whether thefts are more common during certain months or seasons, helping optimize security during peak periods.



How to Use

1. Data Preprocessing:

Load the dataset into your environment.

Clean missing values using the provided code and replace or drop irrelevant rows.



2. Visualizations:

Use the provided Plotly code to create interactive visualizations of theft trends, regional analyses, and correlations.
